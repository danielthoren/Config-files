** Key map
  A key map is a prefix command to enter a mode, after which commands
  can be entered. For example, the key map for rectangle mode is:

  Rectangle mode key map: [C-x r]

  After pressing this key map, a command can be entered, for example
  the command to cut the currently marked rectangle:

  Cut the currently marked rectangle: [k]

  In this case, the whole sequence would be: [C-x r k]
