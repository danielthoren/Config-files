#+STARTUP: showeverything

* High priority
  - [ ] Emacs: Fix release 1 of block comment mode
  - [ ] Emacs: Change behaviour of yanking from the kill-ring. Make a yank
               not move the yank pointer
* Medium priority
  - [ ] Emacs: Fix quick position save using registers
               A quicker command that saves the current position to a register,
               not requiring the user to enter a register.

  - [ ] Config: Add colored output from config scripts
  - [ ] Config: Add dependency list to keep track of dependencies instead of
                having one if statement per dependency scattered among the
                config files

* Low Priority
  - [ ] Emacs: Change ediff buffer positions. Now the buffers are
               split horizontally, want vertical split

  - [ ] Config: Determine how scoping works for argument parser
  - [ ] Config: Look over config script structure
  - [ ] Config: Look over emacs conf script and remove unused packages
