*** git reset, stash etc does not unstage files
   If you use Git for Windows, this is likely your issue:

   I've had the same problem and stash, hard reset, clean or even all
   of them was still leaving changes behind. What turned out to be the
   problem was the x file mode that was not set properly by git. This
   is a "known issue" with git for windows. The local changes show in
   gitk and git status as old mode 100755 new mode 100644, without any
   actual file differences.

   The fix is to ignore the file mode:
   *git config core.filemode false*
